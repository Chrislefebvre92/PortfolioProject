			<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Chris Lefebvre and I'm currently a student at NSCC studying Database Administration.
			   Before I started at NSCC I worked in the Canadian Armed forces as a Marine Engineer for just shy of 7 years. 
			   I'm a big fan of music from Hip-Hop to Rock & Roll. During my free time I typically play some sort of game.
			   I've always had some sort of console or Computer in my life. It all started with a Nintendo in 1997.
